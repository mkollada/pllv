  "header": "Porchlight Presents is a project focused on creating intimate spaces that are centered around the magic of art and community.",
  "paragraph1": "We put on a variety of events, including concerts, poetry readings, comedy shows, and are open to anything our community is feeling excited to share. We are determined to create spaces that uplift the power of receiving and sharing art. We hope these spaces bring rest, connection, and hope to artists and the community that gathers around them.",
  "paragraph2": "For now, our events take place in apartments and venues around New York City, but our dream is to open a venue of our own. We hope to own a space that creates an inclusive and intimate environment for both performers and audiences. We know how vulnerable the act of sharing art is, and we aim to create a venue that encourages and inspires our community. ",
  "paragraph3": "Our hope with the space is to be self-supporting through donations and memberships for both artists and audience members. Creating this space won’t be an easy feat, and the start-up costs are hefty. If you’d like to support us as we get our feet off the ground, consider donating and know that we’re endlessly grateful for any amount."
