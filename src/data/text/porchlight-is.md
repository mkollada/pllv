Porchlight presents is a project focused on creating warm, spacious places and moments to share and listen. We  put on shows, with music, poetry, anything else that people are excited to share with us. We believe in the magic of listening and sharing together, and doing the work to make this possible gives us a profound meaning. In a world that so often is lacking, we hope to create gatherings that bring rest, connection, and hope to artists and the community that gathers around them. Our goal is to make anyone who feels connected to this message feel comfortable and supported at our shows.

Right now our shows take place in apartments and venues around New York City (especially Brooklyn), but our dream is to create and run a venue that is all our own. A space that feels wonderful to be in, that cares and supports everyone that is a part of it - the artists, the employees, and the listeners that together make it possible. If that sounds like something you're excited about and you want to support us, consider donating to help us with start up costs (rent/security deposit, gear, etc.). We're stoked about donations of any size :)
