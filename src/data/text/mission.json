Our main desire is to build a community around performing arts and uplift the voices within our space. We value the intimacy and vulnerability it takes to share your art, and we aim to create a venue that encourages and inspires our acts. We give back to our performers and community as much as financially possible while still sustainingng this space. Through donations and memberships, we keep our doors and arms open to anyone desiring a space for creativity to blossom. ",

  "mission_matt": "Our mission is to cultivate a special space to listen. A space that recognizes music, reading, and other forms of performance as a means of connecting to ourselves and our community. We believe this an incredibly promising and healthy practice for both. Our community is made up of the performers on the stage, the listeners that fill the room, and the staff that make it all happen - each playing a truly vital part. We believe that creating a great space means organizing ourselves around supporting these people how we can, and in the world we live in today that can especially mean financially. Simply put, we are not here to make a lot of money. We are committed to paying our artists fairly, not keeping people out of our spaces for lack of ability to pay, and to supporting those who work for us financially. We acknowledge this as a lofty goal and believe the path to achieving this is through putting our hearts into building something special enough that those who have the means to support us will do so happily."
